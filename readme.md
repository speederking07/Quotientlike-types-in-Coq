# Quotient like types in coq 

This is a repo of my master's thesis written as part of my studies at the University of Wroc≈Çaw.

## Abstract 

Despite many applications for quotient types, Coq does not have built-in support for
them. This thesis will discuss how to mitigate this problem by defining quotient-like
types in which precisely one element exists for each abstraction class. We will focus
on two approaches: the first relies on subtyping, while the second involves defining
inductive types based on normalization traces. Additionally, we will mention other
methods of defining quotient types, such as using setoids, additional axioms, or
higher inductive types.
