\section{Subtyping}
\begin{defi}{Subtypes}{def:subtypes}
A \emph{subtype} $A \sqsubseteq B$ is a type that contains a specific subset of elements of the underlying type $B$.
\end{defi}
\begin{example}{}{ex:subtype}
A great example of a subtype is the type of even numbers, a subtype of natural numbers.
\end{example}
Subtyping is a pretty intuitive concept. However, subtyping in Coq can be tricky for users accustomed to object-oriented languages like Java \cite{Java}. In such languages, subtyping is usually associated with the concept of inheritance and is used to define polymorphic construction. In other words, we can use an element for a subtype when an element of the underlying type is required. Similarly, in math, we expect an even number to be a natural number. Unfortunately, such intuitions do not apply in Coq.
\begin{defi}{Subtypes in Coq}{def:siq}
\begin{minted}{coq}
Inductive sig (A : Type) (P : A -> Prop) : Type :=
    exist : forall x : A, P x -> sig P.
\end{minted}
\end{defi}
\begin{defi}{Subtypes in Coq using record}{def:siq'}
\begin{minted}{coq}
Record sig' (A : Type) (P : A -> Prop) : Type := exist' {
    proj1' : A;
    proj2' : P proj1';
}
\end{minted}
\end{defi}
Subtypes in Coq can be defined in two equivalent ways (see definitions \ref{def:siq} and \ref{def:siq'}). The first definition is used in Coq's standard library. The second one nicely shows that a subtype is actually a dependent pair built of two elements, a value, and  the proof that the value satisfies a specific predicate.
\begin{defi}{Depandent pair}{def:dep_pair}
\emph{Dependent pair} is a generalization of pair where the type of the second element depends on the value of the first one.
\end{defi}
\begin{example}{}{ex:dep_pair}
An example of a dependent pair type is the type of pairs of two coprime numbers. The value of the first element determines the type of the second element. For example, if the first element is five, the second element must be a number coprime to five.
\end{example}
Since subtypes are defined as dependent pairs in Coq, we cannot use an element of the subtype as an element of the underlying type. However, in contrast to the majority of programming languages in Coq, we can use subtypes to define concepts like the type of sorted lists and, for example, use this type as a type of argument of the binary search function. The benefits of such function types are obvious for developing reliable software.
\begin{coq}{The notation for subtyping}{coq:subtype_notation}
In Coq, there is a special notation for subtypes: \mcoq{{a : A | P a}} that should resemble mathematical notation for $\{a \in A: P(a)\}$.
\end{coq}
\begin{example}{The subtype of natural numbers less than 10}{ex:lessThanTen}
\begin{minted}{coq}
Definition lessThanTen := {a : nat | a < 10}.
\end{minted}
\end{example}
\subsection{Connetion to quotient types}
Subtyping is the dual construction of quotient types. As mentioned in the introduction, there is no a built-in method for implementing quotient types in Coq. Therefore, we will use subtypes to define types containing only normalized elements of the underlying type. The normalized elements are defined as the image of some normalization function. This construction defines a type where equality is equivalent to a quotient-defining equality relation because every equivalence class is reduced to single element.
\begin{defi}{Subtype of normalized elements}{def:subtype_quot}
\begin{minted}{coq}
Record quotient {A: Type} (f: A -> A) `{normalization f} := {
  val: A;
  valIsNormal: val = f val
}.
\end{minted}
\end{defi}
\section{Duality}
In the previous section, we mentioned that subtyping is a dual concept to quotient types. This optional section explains what it means and why it is the case. Knowledge about category theory would improve the reading experience. However, this part is more of an interesting fact than an integral part of this work, so feel free to skip it.
\begin{defi}[]{Duality}{def:dual}
In category theory, the statement dual to $\sigma$ is denoted as $\sigma^{\textrm{op}}$ and defined by \cite{CategoryTheory}:
\setlist{nolistsep}
\begin{itemize}
    \itemsep 0em 
    \item interchanging the source and target of each morphism in $\sigma$
    \item interchanging the order of composing two morphisms in $\sigma$ 
\end{itemize}
\end{defi}

\begin{vis}[]{Product and coproduct}{vis:dual}
The formal definition of duality might take much effort to understand. A visual example of two dual constructions should give enough insight to comprehend this concept. On the left side, we see a product, and on the right side, a dual construction to product, known as a coproduct.
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[node/.style={circle, draw=black!60, very thick, minimum size=0.4}]

    \draw[->, thick] (pX) -- (pB) node [right, midway] {$f_2$};

    \draw[->, thick] (cA) -- (cX) node [left, midway] {$f_1$};
    \draw[->, thick] (cB) -- (cX) node [right, midway] {$f_2$};
    \draw[->, thick, dashed] (cS) -- (cX) node [right, midway] {$f$};
    
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
Both diagrams commute, meaning that all directed paths in the diagram with the same start and endpoints lead to the same result \cite{CategoryTheory}.
\end{vis}
In other words, we can construct a dual concept by reversing each arrow (morphism) in the diagram. However, definitions of subtyping and quotient types
do not seems to have any arrows. In order to find them, we need to look into pushouts and pullbacks constructions known from category theory \cite{CategoryTheory}.
\subsection{Pushout}
\begin{defi}{Pushout}{def:pusout}
The \emph{pushout} \cite{CategoryTheory} $P$ is defined by two morphisms $f: X \rightarrow A$ and $g: X \rightarrow B$, with common domain $X$.
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[node/.style={circle, draw=black!60, very thick, minimum size=0.4}]
    %Nodes
    \node[] at (0, 0) (a) {$A$};
    \node[] at (2, 0) (p) {$P$};
    \node[] at (0, 2) (x) {$X$};
    \node[] at (2, 2) (b) {$B$};
    
    \node[] at (3.5, -1.5) (q) {$Q$};
    
    %Lines
    \draw[->, thick] (x) -- (a) node [left, midway] {$f$};
    \draw[->, thick] (x) -- (b) node [above, midway] {$g$};
    \draw[->, thick] (a) -- (p) node [below, midway] {$\eta_1$};
    \draw[->, thick] (b) -- (p) node [right, midway] {$\eta_2$};
    \draw[->, thick] (a) .. controls +(1.25, -1.2) .. (q) node [below, midway] {$\zeta_1$};
    \draw[->, thick] (b) .. controls +(1.2, -1.25) .. (q) node [right, midway] {$\zeta_2$};
    \draw[->, thick, dashed] (p) -- (q) node [right, midway] {$u$};
    
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
The pushout $P$ is an object along with two morphisms $\eta_1: A \rightarrow P$ and $\eta_2: B \rightarrow P$ that complete commutative square with two given morphisms $f: X \rightarrow A$ and $g: X \rightarrow B$. However, not every object that makes the square commutative is a pushout. The pushout must be the "most general" way to complete the commutative square. By the "most general" way, we mean that for every other object Q, which also completes commutative square with two morphisms $\zeta_1: A \rightarrow Q$ and $\zeta_2: B \rightarrow Q$, a unique morphism $u: P \rightarrow Q$ must exist that makes the whole diagram commutative. Not for all morphisms $f: X \rightarrow A$ and $g: X \rightarrow B$, pushout exists, but if it exists, it is unique up to the unique isomorphism.
\end{defi}
The pushout is a useful concept in category theory, but its connection to quotient types is not obvious. To see this connection let us take a trip to the world of \emph{Set} category. In this category, sets are objects, and functions between sets are morphisms. We will show that, indeed, in this category, quotient types are pushouts. On the diagram of the pushout definition, we can see that $A$, $B$, and $P$ define something in the shape of a coproduct. Let us use coproduct $A \oplus B$ as a base for the pushout definition and let functions $\eta_1: A \rightarrow A \oplus B$ and $\eta_2: B \rightarrow A \oplus B$ be natural injections. For $A \oplus B$ to be pushout, we also need to ensure that $X$, $A$, $B$ and $A \oplus B$ are commutative square, that means for every $x \in X$ following should be true $\eta_1(f(x)) = \eta_2(g(x))$. In order to achieve that, we need to modify $A \oplus B$, by gluing together injections of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ in $A \oplus B$. As we know, gluing together elements means defining the quotient type $P = ((A \oplus B) / \sim)$, where for every $x \in X$ $f(x) \sim g(x)$. For $P = ((A \oplus B) / \sim)$ to be a pushout, we need to define $(\sim)$ as the largest in terms of equivalence classes relation that completes the commutative square. 
\begin{theo}{}{th:pushout}
If there exists a larger equivalence relation $(\simeq)$ that $X$, $A$, $B$, and $Q = ((A \oplus B
)/\simeq)$ also commutes, then there cannot exist a unique morphism $u: P \rightarrow Q$ that makes whole diagram commutative. 
\end{theo}

\begin{proof}{}{proof:pushout}
Since $|Q| > |P|$, morphism $u$ cannot be a surjection it follows that there exist $y \in Q$ such that for all  $x \in P$ $u(x)$ is not equal to $y$. 
Without loss of generality exists $a \in A$ such that $\zeta_1(a) = y$. From commutivity we know that $\zeta_1(a) = u(\eta_1(a))$, but $\eta_1(a) \in P$. \contradiction
\end{proof}

\begin{example}{Circle defined by a pushout}{ex:circ}
In category \emph{Set}, we can use a pushout to construct a circle out of two bounded lines $[0, 1]$. Let us define two morphisms $f: \{0, 1\} \rightarrow  [0, 1]$ and $g: \{0, 1\} \rightarrow  [0, 1]$ as identity functions. Let $C$ be pushout defined by such morphisms.

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[node/.style={circle, draw=black!60, very thick, minimum size=0.4}]
    %Nodes
    \node[] at (0, 0) (a) {$[0, 1]$};
    \node[] at (2, 0) (p) {$C$};
    \node[] at (0, 2) (x) {$\{0, 1\}$};
    \node[] at (2, 2) (b) {$[0, 1]$};
    
    %Lines
    \draw[->, thick] (x) -- (a) node [left, midway] {$id$};
    \draw[->, thick] (x) -- (b) node [above, midway] {$id$};
    \draw[->, thick] (a) -- (p) node [below, midway] {$\eta_1$};
    \draw[->, thick] (b) -- (p) node [right, midway] {$\eta_2$};;
    
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
Let us check if $C$ is a circle. Since the diagram above commutes then, we know that $\eta_1(0) = \eta_2(0)$ and $\eta_1(1) = \eta_2(1)$ so, we glued together two points. Moreover, we know that $C$ is defined by the equivalence relation largest in terms of equivalence classes. Therefore every other point of both bounded lines has to have a natural injection into $C$. Based on this, we can conclude that $C$ represents a circle. This construction can be generalized for $n$-dimensional hyper-spheres. Gluing together two $n$-dimensional hemispheres alongside $(n-1)$-dimensional sphere, gives a $n$-dimmensional sphere.
\end{example}

\subsection{Pullback}
Knowing that a pullback is a dual construction to pushout and knowing what dual construction is, everyone should be able to draw a pushout defining diagram.
\begin{defi}{Pullback}{def:pullback}
The pullback \cite{CategoryTheory} $P$ is defined by two morphisms $f: A \rightarrow X$ and $g: B \rightarrow X$, with common codomain $X$.
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[node/.style={circle, draw=black!60, very thick, minimum size=0.4}]
    %Nodes
    \node[] at (0, 0) (a) {$A$};
    \node[] at (0, 2) (p) {$P$};
    \node[] at (2, 0) (x) {$X$};
    \node[] at (2, 2) (b) {$B$};
    
    \node[] at (-1.5, 3.5) (q) {$Q$};
    
    %Lines
    \draw[->, thick] (a) -- (x) node [below, midway] {$f$};
    \draw[->, thick] (b) -- (x) node [right, midway] {$g$};
    \draw[->, thick] (p) -- (a) node [left, midway] {$\pi_1$};
    \draw[->, thick] (p) -- (b) node [above, midway] {$\pi_2$};
    \draw[->, thick] (q) .. controls +(0.2, -2) .. (a) node [left, midway] {$\zeta_1$};
    \draw[->, thick] (q) .. controls +(2, -0.2) .. (b) node [above, midway] {$\zeta_2$};
    \draw[->, thick, dashed] (q) -- (p) node [right, midway] {$u$};
    
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
The pullback $P$ is an object along with two morphisms $\pi_1: P \rightarrow A$ and $\pi_2: P \rightarrow B$ that complete commutative square with two given morphisms $f: A \rightarrow X$ and $g: B \rightarrow X$. However, not every object that makes the square commutative is a pullback. The pullback must be the "most general" way to complete the commutative square. By the "most general" way, we mean that for every other object Q, which also completes commutative square with two morphisms $\zeta_1: Q \rightarrow A$ and $\zeta_2: Q \rightarrow B$, a unique morphism $u: Q \rightarrow P$ must exist that makes the whole diagram commutative. Not for all morphisms $f: A \rightarrow X$ and $g: B \rightarrow X$, pullback exists, but if it exists, it is unique up to the unique isomorphism.
\end{defi}
In order to understand the connection between a pullback and subtyping, we again take a trip to the \emph{Set} category. As expected in dual construction, in the pullback $A$, $B$, and $P$ are in the shape of a product. Therefore, let us use product $A \times B$ as the base for the pushout definition and let functions $\pi_1: A \times B \rightarrow A$ and $\pi_2: A \times B \rightarrow B$ be natural projections. In order to complete the commutative square for every $p \in A \times B$, the following needs to be true $f (\pi_1 (p)) = g (\pi_2(p))$. Therefore, we need to use the following subset $P = \{(a, b) \in A \times B : f(a) = g(b)\}$. 
\begin{theo}{}{th:pulback}
For every other subset $Q \subseteq A \times B$ and two morphisms $\zeta_1: Q \rightarrow A$ and $\zeta_1: Q \rightarrow B$ that completes the commutative square, there exists a unique morphism $u: Q \rightarrow P$ makes the whole diagram commutative.
\end{theo}
\begin{proof}{}{proof:pullback}
Let define $u(q) = (\zeta_1(q), \zeta_2(q))$. Since $\pi$ functions are simple projections the following is true $\zeta_1 = \pi_1 \circ u$ and $\zeta_2 = \pi_2 \circ u$. \qed
\end{proof}
\begin{example}{Pairs of natural numbers of this same parity}{ex:parity_pair}
In category \emph{Set}, we can use the pullback to define the set of pairs of integers with this same parity. Let us define morphism $f(n) = n \; \textrm{mod} \; 2$ that checks the parity of an integer.
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[node/.style={circle, draw=black!60, very thick, minimum size=0.4}]
    %Nodes
    \node[] at (0, 0) (a) {$\mathbb{Z}$};
    \node[] at (0, 2) (p) {$P$};
    \node[] at (2, 0) (x) {$\{0, 1\}$};
    \node[] at (2, 2) (b) {$\mathbb{Z}$};
    
    %Lines
    \draw[->, thick] (a) -- (x) node [below, midway] {$f$};
    \draw[->, thick] (b) -- (x) node [right, midway] {$f$};
    \draw[->, thick] (p) -- (a) node [left, midway] {$\pi_1$};
    \draw[->, thick] (p) -- (b) node [above, midway] {$\pi_2$};;
    
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
As we know, the "most general" $P$ that completes this commutative square is $\{(n, m) \in \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} : n \equiv_2 m\}$.
\end{example}
\subsection{Conclusion}
As shown in the examples above, the pushout can define quotient types in category theory, and the pullback can be used to define subtypes.  Those two constructions are mutually dual. Therefore we can call subtyping a dual concept to quotients types.
\section{Uniquness of representation}
In Coq, subtyping is realized using dependent pairs of value and proof that the value satisfies the subtype defining predicate. Unfortunately, this means that only some properties of subtypes known from mathematics hold in Coq. As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, we cannot use a member of a subtype as a member of the underlying type. This particular problem is easy to fix using projections. The other consequence of using dependent pair related to using subtyping as quotient types is that we cannot prove that only one member of subtype exists for every value that satisfies the subtype defining predicate. As we know irrelevance of proofs is independent of axioms of the \mcoq{Prop} universe \cite{CoqBook2}. It is a major problem since we want to use subtyping to reduce each equivalence class to a single element. The possibility of the existence of multiple elements that only differ by proof of subtype defining predicate makes this construction useless for quotient types applications. Hence, we need to define the subset of quotient types for which its subtype representations are unique or redefine this construction for these purposes.
\begin{defi}{Class of subtypes with unique represenations}{def:unique_representation}
\begin{minted}{coq}
Class unique_representation {A: Type} (P: A -> Prop) := 
  { uniq : forall (x y : {a : A | P a}), 
    proj1_sig x = proj1_sig y -> x = y }.
\end{minted}
\end{defi}
\begin{coq}{}{coq:proj1_sig}
In coq function \mcoq{proj1_sig} is a projection of the subtype value. It can be thought of as a lifting to the underlying type.
\end{coq}
\subsection{Axiomatic approach}
As mentioned in the introduction, we avoid using axioms in this paper. However, it is worth considering their effect on this problem and if it is safe to use them.
\subsubsection{Proof irrelevance axiom}
Proof irrelevance is a known concept in computer science \cite{ProofIrrelevance}. It states that every two proofs of this same statement are equal.
\begin{defi}{Axiom of proof irrelevance}{def:proof_irrelevance}
\begin{minted}{coq}
Definition Irrelevance := forall (P: Prop) (x y: P), x = y.
\end{minted}
\end{defi}
Using this axiom, we can easily prove that every subtype has unique representation (as defined in \ref{def:unique_representation}).
\begin{theo}{}{th:irr_uniq}
    \begin{minted}{coq}
Theorem irrelevance_impl_unique_representation : Irrelevance -> 
  forall (A: Type) (P: A -> Prop), unique_representation P.
    \end{minted}
\end{theo}
\begin{proof}{}{proof:irr_uniq}
    \begin{minted}{coq}
intros Irr A P. constructor. intros [x xp] [y yp] H.
cbn in H. subst.
Require Import Coq.Logic.EqdepFacts.
apply eq_dep_eq_sig.
specialize (Irr (P y) xp yp); subst.
constructor. Qed.
\end{minted}
\end{proof}
Those two statements are equivalent. Thus, the axiom of proof irrelevance is required for every subtype to have a unique representations.
\begin{theo}{}{th:irr_uniq2}
    \begin{minted}{coq}
Theorem unique_representation_impl_irrelevance : 
  (forall (A: Type) (P: A -> Prop), unique_representation P) -> 
  Irrelevance.
    \end{minted}
\end{theo}
\begin{proof}{}{proof:irr_uniq2}
    \begin{minted}{coq}
intros Uniq P x y.
specialize (Uniq unit (fun _ => P)). destruct Uniq as [Uniq].
specialize (Uniq (exist _ tt x) (exist _ tt y) eq_refl).
Require Import Coq.Logic.Eqdep_dec.
refine (eq_dep_eq_dec (A := unit) _ _).
- intros. left. destruct x0, y0. reflexivity.
- apply eq_sig_eq_dep. apply Uniq. Qed.
\end{minted}
\end{proof}
\begin{coq}{Dependent equality}{coq:eq_dep}
In coq, \emph{dependent equality} is defined as:
\begin{minted}{coq}
Inductive eq_dep (U : Type) (P : U -> Type) (p : U) (x : P p) 
  : forall q : U, P q -> Prop :=
    eq_dep_intro : eq_dep U P p x p x.
\end{minted}
Proofs above use additional theorems \mcoq{eq_dep_eq_sig} state that if two values as dependently equal, then subtypes made of them are equal. The second one, \mcoq{eq_sig_eq_dep}, states that for types with decidable equality, dependent equality implies equality.
\end{coq}

\subsubsection{Axiom K}
Axiom K (also known as Uniqueness of Identity Proof) is a weaker version of the proof irrelevance axiom. It states that two proofs of this same equality are equal. Thomas Streicher first introduced it in his habilitation thesis \cite{Streicher}.
\begin{defi}{Axiom K}{def:axiom_K}
\begin{minted}{coq}
Definition K := forall (A: Type) (x y: A) (p q: x = y), p = q.
\end{minted}
\end{defi}
\begin{coq}{Embedding dependent equality in equality}{coq:eq_emb}
Interesting consequence of using axiom K is that it embeds dependent equality in equality.
\begin{minted}{coq}
Fact eq_dep_embedded_in_eq : forall (A : Type) (P : A -> Prop)
  (a : A) (p q : P a), eq_dep A P a p a q -> p = q.
\end{minted}
Proof of this fact is outside the scope of this section, but it can be found in \coqsource{Extras/Stricher.v}.
\end{coq}
Since axiom K is weaker than the proof irrelevance axiom, we cannot prove that every subtype is a class of unique representations. However, we can use it to prove that every quotient (defined in \ref{def:subtype_quot}) has unique representations.
\begin{theo}{}{th:subtype_quot_uniq}
\begin{minted}{coq}
Theorem quotient_unique_representation: K -> forall (A: Type) 
  (f: A -> A) `{normalization A f} (x y : quotient f),
  val x = val y -> x = y.
\end{minted}
\end{theo}
\begin{proof}{}{proof:subtype_quot_uniq}
\begin{minted}{coq}
intros K A f N [x xp] [y yp] H. 
cbn in *. subst. 
specialize (K _ _ _ xp yp). subst. 
reflexivity. Qed.
\end{minted}
\end{proof}
\subsection{Definitional irrelevance approach}
As mentioned in this section, we can add the axiom of proof irrelevance to solve the problem of unique representations for every subtypes. In Coq, there is another approach to proof irrelevance - \mcoq{SProp}.
\begin{coq}[]{\mcoq{SProp} universe}{coq:SProp}
\mcoq{SProp} (Strict Propositions) is a universe of propositions with definitional proof irrelevance as described in \cite{BasesOfSProp}. It is still an experimental feature\cite{coqDoc} of Coq and requires work to be fully functional. The standard library of Coq has several useful constructions for strict propositions:
\begin{description}
    \item \mcoq{Box} -- a record that lifts \mcoq{SProp} proposition to \mcoq{Prop} universe.
    \begin{minted}{coq}
Record Box (A : SProp) : Prop := box { unbox : A }.
    \end{minted}
    \item \mcoq{Squash} -- an inductive type that squashes proposition into \mcoq{SProp} universe making it proof irrelevant.
    \begin{minted}{coq}
Inductive Squash@{u} (A : Type) : SProp :=  
  squash : A -> Squash A.
    \end{minted}
    \item \mcoq{sEmpty} -- an equivalent of \mcoq{False} in \mcoq{Prop}. From \mcoq{sEmpty} anything follows.
    \begin{minted}{coq}
Inductive sEmpty@{} : SProp :=  .
Definition sEmpty_rect : forall (P : sEmpty -> Type) 
  (s : sEmpty), P s.
    \end{minted}
    \item \mcoq{sUnit} -- an equivalent of \mcoq{True} in \mcoq{Prop}.
    \begin{minted}{coq}
Inductive sUnit@{} : SProp :=  stt : sUnit.
    \end{minted}
    \item \mcoq{Ssig} -- subtype defined in \mcoq{SProp} universe.
    \begin{minted}{coq}
Record Ssig (A : Type) (P : A -> SProp) : Type :=
  Sexists { Spr1 : A;  Spr2 : P Spr1 }.
    \end{minted}
\end{description}
\end{coq}
We can easily prove that subtypes defined using \mcoq{Ssig} have unique representations.
\begin{theo}{}{th:ssig}
\begin{minted}{coq}
Theorem Ssig_unique_representation : forall (A : Type) 
  (P : A -> SProp) (a b : Ssig P), Spr1 a = Spr1 b -> a = b.
\end{minted}
\end{theo}
\begin{proof}{}{proof:ssig}
\begin{minted}{coq}
intros A P [a ap] [b bp] H.
cbn in *. subst.
reflexivity. Qed.
\end{minted}
\end{proof}
Using \mcoq{Ssig} is very convenient since having unique representations does not require additional axioms. However, the disadvantage of this approach is that the proof that the value satisfies the subtype defining predicate is in the \mcoq{SProp} universe. Therefore, using this proof in the \mcoq{Prop} universe, where most theorems live, is usually impossible. The only exception is when we can use it to prove \mcoq{sEmpty}.
\subsection{Homotopic approach}
If we want to work in the \mcoq{Prop} universe without additional axioms, we must find underlying types with unique identity poofs. It is a challenging task. Nevertheless, with help comes Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) \cite{HoTT}. It is a relatively new Type Theory branch focusing on identity proofs. Homotopic interpretation of a type is $\omega$-grupoid. In such groupoid, nodes represent members of a type; paths represent identity proofs; paths between paths represent identity proofs of identity proofs, and so forth. 
\subsubsection{Homotopy $n$-types}
Homotopy $n$-types creates a type hierarchy based on the complexity of identity poofs structure ($\omega$-grupoid structure).
\begin{example}{Selected $n$-types}{ex:n_types}
Developing intuition regarding this concept is important before formally defining the $n$-th type. Therefore, we will discuss the three most important examples of $n$-types for this thesis.
\begin{description}
    \item \mcoq{Contr} -- it is the lowest minus-second universe. The type that lives in \mcoq{Contr} has exactly one element. A good example of $(-2)$-type is a \mcoq{unit}.
    \begin{minted}{coq}
 Class isContr (A: Type) := ContrBuilder {
   center : A;
   contr  : forall x: A, x = center
 }.
    \end{minted}
    \item \mcoq{HProp} -- it is the minus-first universe. Not to be confused with Coq's \mcoq{Prop}. The type that lives in it has every element equal to each other. A good example of $(-1)$-type is \mcoq{Empty_set}. We can easily prove that each element of the empty type is the same element. However, it has no elements, so it cannot live in \mcoq{Contr}.
        \begin{minted}{coq}
 Class isHProp (P : Type) :=
   hProp : forall p q : P, p = q.
    \end{minted}
    \item \mcoq{HSet} -- it is the zero universe. Not to be confused with Coq's \mcoq{Set}. The type that lives in it has unique identity proofs. A good example of $0$-type is \mcoq{boo}l. We will later in this section show that it has unique identity proofs. Moreover, it has two elements, so it does not live in \mcoq{HProp}.
    \begin{minted}{coq}
 Class isHSet (X : Type) :=
   hSet : forall (x y : X) (p q : x = y), p = q.
    \end{minted}
\end{description}
\end{example}
\begin{defi}{$N$-th type}{def:nth_type}
\begin{minted}{coq}
Inductive universe : Type :=
| minus_two  : universe
| S_universe : universe -> universe.

Fixpoint isNType (n : universe) (A : Type) : Type :=
match n with
| minus_two => isContr A
| S_universe n' => forall x y: A, isNType n' (x = y)
end.
\end{minted}
\end{defi}
As we see in the definition, $n$-types are defined by where identity proofs of elements of those types live. The hierarchy starts at the $(-2)$-type, where only the most primitive contactable types live. Types with identity proofs in \mcoq{Contr} live in \mcoq{HProp} since the identity proof type is inhabited for every pair of elements. Therefore, every two elements are equal. Similarly, if identity proofs of type live in \mcoq{HProp}, then the type lives in \mcoq{HSet} since, for every two elements, in the type of identity proofs, every two elements are equal. The other important fact is that every $n$-type is also a $(n+1)$-type.
\begin{theo}{$n$-type inclusion}{th:nth_incl}
\begin{minted}{coq}
Theorem NType_inclusion : forall A: Type, forall n : universe,
  isNType n A -> isNType (S_universe n) A.
\end{minted}
\end{theo}
\begin{proof}{}{proof:nth_incl}
Proof of this theorem can be found in \coqsource{Lib/HoTT.v}.
\end{proof}
\subsubsection{Types with decidable equality}
If the underlying type of quotient (defined in \ref{def:subtype_quot}) lives in the \mcoq{HSet} universe, then we can easily prove that it has a unique representation the same way as in proof \ref{proof:subtype_quot_uniq}. However, proving that a type lives in \mcoq{HSet} is not trivial. Fortunately, Hedberg's theorem \cite{hedberg_1998} gives us a valuable sufficiency condition -- decidable equality.
\begin{defi}{Decidable equality}{def:dec_eq}
\begin{minted}{coq}
Class Decidable (A : Type) :=
  dec : A + (A -> False).
  
Class DecidableEq (A : Type) :=
  dec_eq : forall x y: A, Decidable (x = y).
\end{minted}
\end{defi}
For type be have decidable equality means that there exists an algorithm that, a finite amount of time, decides if two elements of this type are equal.
\begin{theo}{Hedberg's theorem}{th:hedberg}
\begin{minted}{coq}
Theorem hedberg (A : Type) : EqDec A -> isHSet A.
\end{minted}
\end{theo}
\begin{proof}{}{proof:hedberg}
This proof of Hedberg's theorem is based on the paper \cite{HedbergProof}. It is based on the concept of collapsibility.
\begin{minted}{coq}
Class Collapsible (A : Type) := { 
  collapse        : A -> A ;
  wconst_collapse : forall x y: A, collapse x = collapse y;
}.
\end{minted}
It can be easily proven that the type is collapsible if it is decidable.
\begin{minted}{coq}
Theorem dec_is_collaps : forall A : Type, Decidable A -> 
  Collapsible A.
Proof.
  intros A eq. destruct eq.
  - exists (fun x => a). intros x y. reflexivity.
  - exists (fun x => x); intros x y.
    exfalso; apply f; assumption.
Qed.
\end{minted}
This same law applies to the type of identity proofs.
\begin{minted}{coq}
Class PathCollapsible (A : Type) :=
  path_coll : forall (x y : A), Collapsible (x = y).

Theorem eq_dec_is_path_collaps : forall A : Type, 
  DecidableEq A -> PathCollapsible A.
Proof.
  intros A dec x y. apply dec_is_collaps. apply dec.
Qed.
\end{minted}
We need a simple lemma about composition identity proofs.
\begin{minted}{coq}
Lemma loop_eq : forall A: Type, forall x y: A, forall p: x = y, 
  eq_refl = eq_trans (eq_sym p) p.
Proof.
  intros A x y []. cbn. reflexivity.
Qed.
\end{minted}
Using the lemma above, we can prove that type with collapsable paths lives in \mcoq{HSet}.
\begin{minted}{coq}
Theorem path_collaps_is_hset (A : Type) : PathCollapsible A -> 
  isHSet A.
Proof.
  unfold isHSet, PathCollapsible; intros C x y.
  cut (forall e: x=y, e = 
    eq_trans (eq_sym(collapse(eq_refl x))) (collapse e)).
  - intros H p q. 
    rewrite (H q), (H p), (wconst_collapse p q).
    reflexivity.
  - intros []. apply loop_eq.
Qed.
\end{minted}
Composing \mcoq{dec_is_collaps} with \mcoq{path_collaps_is_hset}, we get proof that every type with decidable equality lives in \mcoq{HSet} and has only trivial paths. \qed
\end{proof}
Hedberg's theorem shows that every quotient (defined in \ref{def:subtype_quot}) with an underlying type with decidable equality has unique representations. Since to define such quotient (defined in \ref{def:subtype_quot}), we need to define normalization function (defined in \ref{def:normalization_function}) that should not be an issue.
\subsubsection{Characterization of dependent pair equality}
\begin{coq}{Dependent pair}{coq:dep_pair}
In Coq, the type of \emph{dependant pair} is defined using inductive type.
\begin{minted}{coq}
Inductive sigT (A : Type) (P : A -> Type) : Type :=
  existT : forall x : A, P x -> sigT A P.
\end{minted}
\mcoq{{x : A & P x}} is the notation for dependent pairs.
\end{coq}
Subtypes are based on dependent pairs. Therefore, knowing how the equality of dependent pairs can be characterized is worthwhile. In the case of simple nondependent pairs, the characterization is straightforward.
\begin{theo}{Characterization of pair equality}{th:pair_eq}
\begin{minted}{coq}
Theorem pair_eq : forall (A B: Type) (a x : A) (b y : B),
  (a, b) = (x, y) -> a = x /\ b = y.
\end{minted}
\end{theo}
\begin{proof}{}{proof:pair_eq}
\begin{minted}{coq}
intros. inversion H. split; trivial. Qed.
\end{minted}
\end{proof}
Using this same definition for dependent pairs is impossible. The first issue is the error of ill-defined equality since P x and P y differ in the Coq type system, even if x = y, and elements of two different types cannot be in equality relation. Even if we redefine our problem to the characterization of equality for dependent pairs with this same first element, it is still impossible to characterize it using simple equality. Such equality can be characterized using dependent equality known from Coq's fact \ref{coq:eq_dep}. Moreover, from Coq's fact \ref{coq:eq_emb}, we know that for characterization using simple equality to be correct, the axiom K must be added. To characterize the general case of dependent pairs equality, we need first to define transport of equality path.
\begin{defi}{Transport}{def:transport}
\begin{minted}{coq}
Definition transport {A: Type} {a b: A} {P: A -> Type} 
  (p: a = b) (x : P a) : P b :=
match p with
| eq_refl => x
end.
\end{minted}
\end{defi}
Transport construction moves an element of type \mcoq{P a} to a new type  \mcoq{P b} along the path (proof of equality) \mcoq{p: a = b}. Using this construction, we can characterize equality for dependent pairs.
\begin{vis}[G]{Transport}{vis:transport}
$P$ is a family of types indexed by elements of type $A$. Two elements, $a$ and $b$, are equal in $A$, and $p$ is a proof of this fact (path). Element $x$ of type $P(a)$ can be transported along this proof (path) to type $P(b)$.
