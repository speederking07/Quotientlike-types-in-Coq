abstract="We present a new method to specify a certain class of quotient in intentional type theory, and in the calculus of inductive constructions in particular. We define the notion of ``normalized types''. The main idea is to associate a normalization function to a type, instead of the usual relation. This function allows to compute on a particular element for each equivalence class, avoiding the difficult task of computing on equivalence classes themselves. We restrict ourselves to quotients that allow the construction of such a function, i.e. quotient having a canonical member for each equivalence class. This method is described as an extension of the calculus of constructions allowing normalized types. We prove that this calculus has the properties of strong normalization, subject reduction, decidability of typing. In order to show the example of the definition of ℤ by a normalized type, we finally present a pseudo Coq session.",

We describe the relation between this representation of numbers and the representation as fractions of non-zero natural numbers. The usual operations of comparison, multiplication, and addition are then defined in a naive way. The whole construction is used to build a model of the set of rational numbers as an ordered archimedian field. All constructions have been modeled and verified in the Coq proof assistant.}

The theory of types is intended to be a full-scale system for formalizing intuitionistic mathematics as developed. The language of the theory is richer than the languages of traditional intuitionistic systems in permitting proofs to appear as parts of propositions so that the propositions of the theory can express properties of proofs. There are axioms for universes that link the generation of objects and types and play somewhat the same role for the present theory as does the replacement axiom for Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory. The present theory is based on a strongly impredicative axiom that there is a type of all types in symbols. This axiom has to be abandoned, however, after it has been shown to lead to a contraction. This chapter discusses Normalization theorem, which can be strengthened in two ways: it can be made to cover open terms and it can be proved that every reduction sequence starting from an arbitrary term leads to a unique normal term after a finite number of steps. The definition of the notion of convertibility and the proof that an arbitrary term is convertible can no longer be separated because the type symbols and the terms are generated simultaneously.}
